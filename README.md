# HTMLTestRunner

This file modified for adding screenshots of unit tests to the test report on failure and error cases.

* I added base64 screenshots to the test report. 
* Screenshots will be added to the report automatically on failure and error.
* Report will change after test run so be careful about past report!
* Do not forget to create HtmlTestRunner object.
* After that you must provide stream, dirTestScreenshots, verbosity, title and description by this object.

* For more information send me mail : mertyaman144@gmail.com
